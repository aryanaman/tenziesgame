# Tenzies Game

Tenzies are one of the world's fastest game! Everyone gets ten dice and can play one by one. Someone says, “Go.” Then everyone rolls and rolls as fast as they can until someone gets all their dice on the same number and shouts “TENZI.” Lots of different ways to play. A fun fast frenzy for the whole family!
